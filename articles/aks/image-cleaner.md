# Use Image Cleaner to clean up stale images on your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster

It's common to use pipelines to build and deploy images on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters. While great for image creation, this process often doesn't account for the stale images left behind and can lead to image bloat on cluster nodes. These images may contain vulnerabilities, which may create security issues. To remove security risks in your clusters, you can clean these unreferenced images. Manually cleaning images can be time intensive. Image Cleaner performs automatic image identification and removal, which mitigates the risk of stale images and reduces the time required to clean them up.

> [!NOTE]
> Image Cleaner is a feature based on [Eraser](https://azure.github.io/eraser).
> On an AKS cluster, the feature name and property name is `Image Cleaner`, while the relevant Image Cleaner pods' names contain `Eraser`.

## Prerequisites

* An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, you can create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free).
* Azure CLI version 2.49.0 or later. Run `az --version` to find your version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI][azure-cli-install].

## Limitations

Image Cleaner doesn't yet support Windows node pools or AKS virtual nodes.

## How Image Cleaner works

When you enable Image Cleaner, it deploys an `eraser-controller-manager` pod, which generates an `ImageList` CRD. The eraser pods running on each node clean up any unreferenced and vulnerable images according to the `ImageList`. A [trivy][trivy] scan helps determine vulnerability and flags images with a classification of `LOW`, `MEDIUM`, `HIGH`, or `CRITICAL`. Image Cleaner automatically generates an updated `ImageList` based on a set time interval and can also be supplied manually. Once Image Cleaner generates an `ImageList`, it removes all images in the list from node VMs.

## Configuration options

With Image Cleaner, you can choose between manual and automatic mode and the following configuration options:

|Name|Description|Required|
|----|-----------|--------|
|`--enable-image-cleaner`|Enable the Image Cleaner feature for an AKS cluster|Yes, unless disable is specified|
|`--disable-image-cleaner`|Disable the Image Cleaner feature for an AKS cluster|Yes, unless enable is specified|
|`--image-cleaner-interval-hours`|This parameter determines the interval time (in hours) Image Cleaner uses to run. The default value for Azure CLI is one week, the minimum value is 24 hours and the maximum is three months.|Not required for Azure CLI, required for ARM template or other clients|

> [!NOTE]
> After disabling Image Cleaner, the old configuration still exists. This means if you enable the feature again without explicitly passing configuration, the existing value is used instead of the default.

## Enable Image Cleaner on your AKS cluster

### Enable Image Cleaner on a new cluster

* Enable Image Cleaner on a new AKS cluster using the [`az aks create`][az-aks-create] command with the `--enable-image-cleaner` parameter.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az aks create -g myResourceGroup -n myManagedCluster \
      --enable-image-cleaner
    ```

### Enable Image Cleaner on an existing cluster

* Enable Image Cleaner on an existing AKS cluster using the [`az aks update`][az-aks-update] command.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az aks update -g myResourceGroup -n myManagedCluster \
      --enable-image-cleaner
    ```

### Update the Image Cleaner interval on a new or existing cluster

* Update the Image Cleaner interval on a new or existing AKS cluster using the  `--image-cleaner-interval-hours` parameter.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    # Update the interval on a new cluster
    az aks create -g myResourceGroup -n myManagedCluster \
      --enable-image-cleaner \
      --image-cleaner-interval-hours 48
    # Update the interval on an existing cluster
    az aks update -g myResourceGroup -n myManagedCluster \
      --image-cleaner-interval-hours 48
    ```

After you enable the feature, the `eraser-controller-manager-xxx` pod and `collector-aks-xxx` pod are deployed. The `eraser-aks-xxx` pod contains *three* containers:

  - **Scanner container**: Performs vulnerability image scans
  - **Collector container**: Collects nonrunning and unused images
  - **Remover container**: Removes these images from cluster nodes

Image Cleaner generates an `ImageList` containing nonrunning and vulnerable images at the desired interval based on your configuration. Image Cleaner automatically removes these images from cluster nodes.

## Manually remove images using Image Cleaner

1. Create an `ImageList` using the following example YAML named `image-list.yml`.

    ```yml
    apiVersion: eraser.sh/v1alpha1
    kind: ImageList
    metadata:
      name: imagelist
    spec:
      images:
        - docker.io/library/alpine:3.7.3   # You can also use "*" to specify all non-running images
    ```

2. Apply the `ImageList` to your cluster using the `kubectl apply` command.

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f image-list.yml
    ```

    Applying the `ImageList` triggers a job named `eraser-aks-xxx`, which causes Image Cleaner to remove the desired images from all nodes. Unlike the `eraser-aks-xxx` pod under autoclean with *three* containers, the eraser-pod here has only *one* container.

## Image exclusion list

Images specified in the exclusion list aren't removed from the cluster. Image Cleaner supports system and user-defined exclusion lists. It's not supported to edit the system exclusion list.

### Check the system exclusion list

* Check the system exclusion list using the following `kubectl get` command.

     ```bash
    kubectl get -n kube-system cm eraser-system-exclusion -o yaml
    ```

### Create a user-defined exclusion list

1. Create a sample JSON file to contain excluded images.

    ```bash
    cat > sample.json <<EOF
    {"excluded": ["excluded-image-name"]}
    EOF
    ```

2. Create a `configmap` using the sample JSON file using the following `kubectl create` and `kubectl label` command.

    ```bash
    kubectl create configmap excluded --from-file=sample.json --namespace=kube-system
    kubectl label configmap excluded eraser.sh/exclude.list=true -n kube-system
    ```

3. Verify the images are in the exclusion list using the following `kubectl logs` command.

    ```bash
    kubectl logs -n kube-system <eraser-pod-name>
    ```

## Image Cleaner image logs

Deletion image logs are stored in `eraser-aks-nodepool-xxx` pods for manually deleted images and in `collector-aks-nodes-xxx` pods for automatically deleted images.

You can view these logs using the `kubectl logs <pod name> -n kubesystem` command. However, this command may return only the most recent logs, since older logs are routinely deleted. To view all logs, follow these steps to enable the [Azure Monitor add-on](./monitor-aks.md) and use the Container Insights pod log table.

1. Ensure Azure Monitoring is enabled on your cluster. For detailed steps, see [Enable Container Insights on AKS clusters](../azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-enable-aks.md#existing-aks-cluster).

2. Get the Log Analytics resource ID using the [`az aks show`][az-aks-show] command.

   ```azurecli
   az aks show -g myResourceGroup -n myManagedCluster
   ```

   After a few minutes, the command returns JSON-formatted information about the solution, including the workspace resource ID.

    ```json
   "addonProfiles": {
    "omsagent": {
      "config": {
        "logAnalyticsWorkspaceResourceID": "/subscriptions/<WorkspaceSubscription>/resourceGroups/<DefaultWorkspaceRG>/providers/Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/<defaultWorkspaceName>"
      },
      "enabled": true
    }
   }
    ```

3. In the Azure portal, search for the workspace resource ID, then select **Logs**.

4. Copy this query into the table, replacing `name` with either `eraser-aks-nodepool-xxx` (for manual mode) or `collector-aks-nodes-xxx` (for automatic mode).

   ```kusto
      let startTimestamp = ago(1h);
   KubePodInventory
   | where TimeGenerated > startTimestamp
   | project ContainerID, PodName=Name, Namespace
   | where PodName contains "name" and Namespace startswith "kube-system"
   | distinct ContainerID, PodName
   | join
   (
       ContainerLog
       | where TimeGenerated > startTimestamp
   )
   on ContainerID
   // at this point before the next pipe, columns from both tables are available to be "projected". Due to both
   // tables having a "Name" column, we assign an alias as PodName to one column which we actually want
   | project TimeGenerated, PodName, LogEntry, LogEntrySource
   | summarize by TimeGenerated, LogEntry
   | order by TimeGenerated desc
   ```

5. Select **Run**. Any deleted image logs appear in the **Results** area.

## Disable Image Cleaner

* Disable Image Cleaner on your cluster using the [`az aks update`][az-aks-update] command with the `--disable-image-cleaner` parameter.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az aks update -g myResourceGroup -n myManagedCluster \
      --disable-image-cleaner
    ```
