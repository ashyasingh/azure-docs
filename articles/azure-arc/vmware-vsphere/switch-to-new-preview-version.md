# Switch to the new preview version

On August 21, 2023, we rolled out major changes to Azure Arc-enabled VMware vSphere preview. We are now announcing a new preview. By switching to the new preview version, you can use all the Azure management services that are available for Arc-enabled Servers.  

> [!NOTE]
> If you're a new to Arc-enabled VMware vSphere (preview), you will be able to leverage the new capabilities by default. To get started with the preview, see [Quickstart: Connect VMware vCenter Server to Azure Arc by using the helper script](quick-start-connect-vcenter-to-arc-using-script.md). 

If you have the earlier version of preview installed already, switch to the new version by following the below steps:

## Switch to the new preview version (Existing preview customer)

 Follow these steps to switch to the new preview version: 

>[!Note]
>If you had enabled guest management on any of the VMs, remove [VM extensions](/azure/azure-arc/vmware-vsphere/remove-vcenter-from-arc-vmware#step-1-remove-vm-extensions) and [disconnect agents](/azure/azure-arc/vmware-vsphere/remove-vcenter-from-arc-vmware#step-2-disconnect-the-agent-from-azure-arc).

1. From your browser, go to the vCenters blade on [Azure Arc Center](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_HybridCompute/AzureArcCenterBlade/~/overview) and select the vCenter resource. 

2. Select all the virtual machines that are Azure enabled with the older preview version.  

3. Select **Remove from Azure**.

4. After successful removal from Azure, enable the same resources again in Azure.

5. Once the resources are re-enabled, the VMs are auto switched to the new preview version. The VM resources will now be represented as **Machine - Azure Arc (VMware)**.
